# ðŸ“„ Test Task Description

This task is intended for candidates applying for a Full-Stack Developer position (C#, JavaScript).

## ðŸ§ª Part 1

Develop a small application for submitting web forms, storing submissions, listing, and searching them.

### Requirements:

- Create a form with at least five fields of different types:
  - Text input
  - Drop-down
  - Date
  - Radio buttons
  - Checkbox
- Use CSS and Vue (any version) for the frontend.
- Add validation for the form fields.
- Implement a **REST API** in **C# with ASP.NET Core**:
  - Backend must **not rely on hardcoded models**
  - Should support storing dynamic form data
  - Must provide all necessary endpoints for the frontend
- Use **In-Memory** or any other lightweight storage that doesn't require setup.
- Add a UI for **listing and searching** all submitted forms on a single page.
- Use a build system (Vite or Webpack) to pack all JS and CSS into a single file.

### Notes:

Although the task is basic, treat it as a real-life production case.  
We will evaluate:
- Code quality
- Toolchain usage
- UI usability
- Overall architecture

## ðŸ§© Part 2

Imagine your forms support **large attachments (~100MB)** and there are thousands of submissions with multiple files each.

Write a short text describing:
